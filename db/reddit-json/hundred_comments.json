I didn't get the feeling the guy knows the first thing about programming, and he only provided extremely vague refutations of what Paul Graham had to say.  Nothing concrete, nothing specific.\r\n\r\nThe main point the author focuses on is the superficial differences between painting and programming (one of them is manipulating electronic bits and the other is putting oil on a canvas with a stick and animal hair).  From that he concludes the two things are totally and utterly different from each other.\r\n\r\nClearly this guy is not a real programmer, or probably even a good programmer for that matter.  I am sure that many, or even most programmers are not artists, but that isn't who Paul Graham writes about.  He writes about the great programmers, the ones who write code that reads like poetry, or unfolds like great art.  There are also plenty of programmers who can make you cry just by looking at their code, but that's a different kind of programmer entirely.\r\n\r\nPersonally I thought this article was stupid and filled with the kind of nonsence that he accused Paul Graham of perpetrating.  He complains that Paul Graham, Eric Raymond, and Dave Winer write about things they see in themselves and call that greatness.  Apparently this author writes about the shortcomings and failures he projects from himself onto other people.

An explanation like \"cannabis\" really doesn't cut it. As a matter of fact, the only reference of annointing oils in the New Testament was when a prostitute put them on Christ's feet. Many of the instances of healing in the NT were spontaneous and mention nothing about any oils.\r\n\r\nFor example, a woman who has a menstrual problem touches Christ and is healed. Christ turns around and asks who touched him because \"I felt power go out from me\". There is no mention that Christ turned around and put oils on the woman. She was the one who touched him.\r\n\r\nI imagine this will get promoted purely due to how much people like to read controversial stuff, no matter how far it is from the truth.
