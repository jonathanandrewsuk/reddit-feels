Your visual systems are smart enough to notice that, overall, you're looking through a transparent blue or a transparent yellow. It then compensates color perception based on these filters, giving you a sense of what the true color would be if the semi-transparent filter were removed.\r\n\r\nSure the color values are the same (or close) when you use something to the effect of Photoshop's eye-dropper to compare composite color values, but you have to understand that your visual system is taking into account the surrounding screen of solid color (same can be said for shadows).\r\n\r\nYour brain calculates based on surroundings, and gives your conscious a close approximation of the color's value based on other color values (screens, shadows, et al.).

It seems strange that we have no problem assuming intelligent design if we think something could have been made by a human, but then throw intelligent design as an option out the window when it comes to things that could not have been made by a human.  This approach just begs the question about naturalism.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I would accept methodological naturalism if intelligent design was either prima facie incapable of providing useful knowledge, or was very unlikely to.  Yet, this is blatantly wrong.  If we did not use the assumption of intelligent design in our everyday lives then society would completely fall apart.  So, if it can provide useful information in everyday life, just as looking for naturalistic explanations for everyday events does, then I see no reason why this can't be true on a greater scale.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, it could be more useful than naturalism.  For example, see this excellent article explaining the intelligent design underpinnings of the \"Wealth of Nations.\"\r\nhttp://www.acton.org/publicat/m_and_m/new/article.php?article=8\r\nI am not especially well read in economics.  However, from what I understand, \"Wealth of Nations\" is the ideological basis for our modern capitalistic system that seems to work much better than more recent secular systems, such as communism.  If you take a brief look at the very long article, you'll notice a striking difference between the assumptions Smith makes about human nature and those Marx makes, and that Smith's assumptions are firmly rooted in the assumption of intelligent design whereas Marx assumes there are only mechanical causes at work in nature. \r\n\r\n--------\r\nMorality\r\n\r\nMorality is essentially rational self interest.  Thus, it takes into account both avoiding what is bad and getting what is good.  However, bad and good change depending on whether you believe people have eternal souls or are just another type of animal.  Believing people have souls affects morality in two ways.  First, and most importantly, the extent to which you truly believe this impacts how inherently valuable you think people really are.  Second, if these souls are created, then their creator will punish those who abuse the souls.\r\n\r\nHowever, morality that is merely a human construct and is contrary to people's inherent value deserves to be broken.  Neither you nor I should ever let anyone rule over us for their own benefit.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807441,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ct5x8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_svae","author_flair_text":null,"author":"yters"}

I'm glad I stayed away from early Windows and all its funky MSDOS.SYS, CONFIG.SYS memory reservation games. Networking on early MSDOS and early Windows (before WfW days) was a true nightmare too.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft only really applied the pressure when they released Win 95. The company became an evil empire after that with all this IP wrangling, competition FUD, really bad interface defaults guessing (MS Paperclip, anyone?), product bundling, funky EULAs from hell, forced upgrades, and the Embrace, Extend, Extinguish strategies. And then lying and committing perjury in court about how they fought their competition -- that didn't help their cause.\r\n\r\nYou know, at one time, Microsoft could have saved face and played nice with GNU and FLOSS, and everyone could have gotten along rather nicely, but now the trust has been so destroyed that pursuing this would be a lost cause.\r\n\r\nInnovation is not pursued in an environment where there is no freedom of choice. I really have to laugh when I see these commercials where people are encouraged to dream up ideas and use Microsoft tools to get them there. That's a laugh so hard my sides split.\r\n\r\nJoel on Software also had an interesting thing to say about Microsoft APIs the other day that I completely agree with. I think he said that he often finds no compelling reason to upgrade his company's Microsoft development environment. Microsoft keeps renaming their APIs over the same thing, and with very few new features added to make it worth anyone's while. There's far more innovation developing on the Linux platform, which is one reason why I switched to it. Another great big thing is that it got so danged expensive to develop on the Microsoft OS. In order to remain competitive in the MS developer market, you had to purchase MSDN Universal every year and get in all the beta programs, and kiss your spouse and children goodbye while you holed up in a room trying to learn everything all the time. You had to purchase several workstations that you could format and reinstall alpha and beta MS stuff on all the time. You get so sick of installing stuff, come up with an unstable OS, and all the reboots.

Recorded crime levels will be affected by many factors including:\r\n\r\n&gt; a) Different legal and criminal justice systems;\r\n&gt; b) Rates at which crimes are reported to the police and recorded by them;\r\n...\r\n\r\nAnd if you're referring to (trying to deny) the fact that American police have been heavily militarizing and increasingly killing people in \"no knock\" raids, don't even bother.\r\n\r\nFURTHERMORE, your recent (better) sources totally contradict your earlier (weaker) sources.\r\n\r\n&gt; Homicide\r\n\r\n&gt;Since the definition of homicide is similar in most countries, absolute comparisons of rates are possible.

For other countries, the highest rates were found in Russia (22.1), Estonia (10.6), Lithuania (10.6) and the USA (5.6).\r\n\r\nWhich makes a lot more sense than your \"murder and manslaughter figures\". Especially if manslaughter includes vehicular manslaughter which could easily be included in one country (Brussels) but not in another (USA).\r\n\r\nAnd the homicide rates make most sense because the countries that have high rates of internal conflict and poverty, or clinical depression in the case of Finland, are the ones with the highest rates of homicide. This makes sense. Your \"murder and manslaughter\" figures on the other hand are total nonsense.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,\r\n\r\n&gt; In the EU capital cities, the average number of homicides over the period 1999 to 2001 was 2.3 per 100,000 population with the highest rates in Belfast (5.6), Amsterdam (3.1), Vienna (2.8), Stockholm (2.8), London (2.6) and Berlin (2.3).
